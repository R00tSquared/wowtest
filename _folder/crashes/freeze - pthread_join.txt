freezing at random cases, idk

every crashlog starting with:

Program received signal SIGINT, Interrupt.
0x00007ffff5c9049b in pthread_join (threadid=140735877740288, thread_return=0x0) at pthread_join.c:92

and has changes only at backtrace

you can find whem with
grep -lr "SIGINT, Interrupt" /server/core3/logs/crash | xargs grep -r pthread_join | grep '* 1' | grep -v "_04"
